            <hr>
            <p>I'm a sophomore at Ateneo de Manila University taking 
up a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology<br> Entrepreneurship.
As a student, I am consistent when it comes to tasks, goals and objectives.
 I am really<br> good in time management, especially in balancing my org work, academic work and personal time.<br><br>
 I am very open minded, meaning I am very adaptable in learning different stuff
  from other people's opinions<br> without sacrificing my own set of skills. I am committed   when it comes to
important and small stuff, meaning<br> I give importance to any tasks. I value communication
 a lot because I think it's one of the most important<br> aspect in making an event or any team
 related activity work.<br><br> And most of all, I am very passionate in all the things I am interested in.</p>
